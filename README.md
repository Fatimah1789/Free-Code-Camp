# Free Code Camp - Responsive Web Design

This Repo will be about my progress in learning front end development technologies such as HTML, CSS JavaScript etc with freeCodeCamp. Based on what I have learnt I will create my own mini projects starting off with the basics and then building upon it whilst I go through the Responsive Design Web Course by FreeCodeCamp.
